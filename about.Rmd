## Biography

I've been a math professor at North Shore Community College for the past 5 years. 
I'm a data enthusiast, eagerly learning everything I can about statistics, programming, 
and creating cool data products.

## Projects  
* [Next word prediction app](https://action781.shinyapps.io/text_prediction_shiny_app/) - 
An app that functions like the "word prediction" function
in text messaging apps.  It takes in a phrase and predicts the next word.  

* NBA Salary app - An app that scrapes NBA player salaries from the web and compiles them into one 
table that is sortable, filterable, and other cool things a user can do.
